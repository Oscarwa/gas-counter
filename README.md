# Gas Tracker
Gasoline spent tracker is an app to track every gas refill for your car having history, graphs (soon), gas performance and some other statistics

# Usage
The whole page uses LocalStorage for preserving data so use the same browser and device for tracking. Sync between devices will be added later.
You just need to add either how much gas you refilled or how many you spent in refill and the calculation will be made to define the price or quantity, also you must enter the mileage of your car, this last input is for gas performance statistics.
